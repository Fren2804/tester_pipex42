# Tester for Pipex (42 School)

A simple tester for the **Pipex** project from School 42, built for **Linux** systems. üêß

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This tester is written **only for Linux**.

If this tester was useful to you, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you left a ‚≠ê on the repo to help others find it!

If you find a bug, my apologies in advance ‚Äî feel free to reach out to me on Slack (@franmore) üìß

I‚Äôve tried to cover all the relevant cases. If I missed any, I‚Äôm sorry!  
Regarding the `bonus2` tests (the `DELIMITER`), there's only one test included. I‚Äôm not sure it works correctly because I couldn't test that part with my own code. ‚ùó


# Usage

## Download and Installation

Clone the repository **into your Pipex directory**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fren2804/tester_pipex42.git

```
Move the `*.sh` file from the tester folder to the root of your Pipex directory:

![Files Organization](Files_Org.png)

## Run
Use this command:
```bash
bash tester_pipex.sh [flag]

```
Available flags (use only one at a time):
| Flag      | Description                                         |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `-nobonus` | Executes tests for Pipex without bonus features     |
| `-bonus1`  | Executes `-nobonus` tests + multiple command support |
| `-bonus2`  | Executes `-bonus1` tests + delimiter (here_doc)     |

If your `make` command puts the `pipex` binary in a different directory, you must set the correct path in `tester_pipex.sh`, on **line 18** (`pipex_dir`):

 bash tester_pipex.sh
