# Tester for Pipex (42 School)

A simple tester for the **Pipex** project from School 42, built for **Linux** systems. 🐧

> ⚠️ This tester is written **only for Linux**.

If this tester was useful to you, I’d really appreciate it if you left a ⭐ on the repo to help others find it!

If you find a bug, my apologies in advance — feel free to reach out to me on Slack (@franmore) 📧

I’ve tried to cover all the relevant cases. If I missed any, I’m sorry!  
Regarding the `bonus2` tests (the `DELIMITER`), there's only one test included. I’m not sure it works correctly because I couldn't test that part with my own code. ❗


# Installation
